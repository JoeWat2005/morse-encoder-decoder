# Morse Code Encoding and Parsing in Haskell

This repository contains my solution to **Assignment 2**, which focuses on functional programming techniques in **Haskell**, including recursion, algebraic data types, and tree-based representations.

## Overview

The assignment explores multiple representations and transformations of Morse code, as well as recursive parsing of structured input. The completed tasks include:

- Encoding text into Morse code using lookup tables
- Decoding Morse code back into text
- Tree-based decoding using a binary Morse tree
- Converting between table and tree representations
- Implementing a recursive parser for well-bracketed strings

All implementations follow the provided assignment template and required type signatures.

## Repository Structure

- `Assignment2.hs`  
  Main solution file containing all completed exercises.

- `Types.hs`  
  Preset data types and helper definitions provided for the assignment.

- `DETAILS.md`  
  The original assignment specification describing the exercises that were completed.

- `presubmit.sh`  
  Script used to verify compilation and submission readiness.

- `morse_tree.jpg`  
  Diagram illustrating the binary Morse code tree structure.

- `.gitignore`  
  Git ignore rules for Haskell build artifacts.

## Notes

This repository is intended for **educational purposes** and reflects coursework completed as part of a university functional programming module.
